  ## Description:
  In this homework assignment, I created a command line application to generate a team of interns, engineers, and managers. The user will enter a name, id, and email. When prompted for intern, engineer or manager the user will select one and additional questions will follow. Once all information is entered a HTML will be generated.

  ## Installation:
  The user will use Inquirer npm package. And to run the test npm run test will be used. Also be sure to use npm install before installing the inquirer package.

  ## Usage:
  It can be used to create a team using a command line application.
